# Wind Speed Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing wind speed data collected from the Belmullet weather station. The objective is to explore patterns, trends, and insights that could support decision-making related to wind energy projects or other meteorological studies.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:

   - Contains the Python code used for data analysis and visualization.
   - Steps include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical summarisation.

2. **Dataset**:

   - `belmullet_wind_speed_dataset.csv`: The raw dataset used in this project.

3. **README**:

   - This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for usage.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, I ensured the following packages were necessary:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Project Objectives

The analysis addresses the following questions:

- What are the distribution and trends in wind speed over time?
- What are the average wind speeds across different months?
- How can these insights support wind energy initiatives?

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**:

- Handle missing values.
- Convert data types for ease of analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

- Summary statistics for wind speed, temperature, and rainfall.
- Visualisations for wind speed distribution, time-series trends, and monthly averages.

3. **Visualisation**:

- Histograms to represent wind speed distribution.
- Time-series plots to visualize trends.
- Bar plots for monthly wind speed averages.
